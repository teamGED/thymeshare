# ThymeShare
Sprouting a Food Share Revolution

## What is it?
ThymeShare is a produce sharing application that helps to connect people who like fresh fruits and vegetables to urban farmers. It ensures that the growers' labor will never go to waste because there always will be a hungry person ready to take things off their hands. The platform allows farmers to submit the produce they have to give away and it displays on their profile. Users may see on a map which items are available in their area and contact the farmers.
